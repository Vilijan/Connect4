In this repository I have created an intelligent agent using reinforcement learning that learned how to play the game Connect4. I have experimented with DQN, minimax-DQN and DDQN algorithms.

The [ConnectX](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx/overview "Named link title") competition that is happening on Kaggle has motivated me to learn how to create this kind of agents. The most trained agents based on the code in this repository managed to achive top 15% ranking in the competition.
